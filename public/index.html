<title>LeapMotion Testing of Swipe</title>

<script src="http://js.leapmotion.com/0.2.0/leap.js"></script>

<body>

<!-- 
This is a simple example of using Javascript with the LeapMotion.
All that this does is to open the LeapMotion and look for a few gestures of different types.
When these are detected counters will appear and be incremented in the html
on the page.
A swipe gesture is defined as "something" moving from one side of the field
of view to the other side.  Note that individual fingers are counted so
a single finger being observed will be seen as one swipe.
A tap gesture is equivalent to poking at the screen.

The debug var can be set to 0 or non-zero and the larger the number
the increased level of debug output to the JS console if you turn on developer mode
in your browser.  I am primarily using Chrome but Safari also works for me.

This page was very helpful while working on this:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18018642/detecting-swipe-gesture-direction-with-leap-motion

The webpage should look something like this if you have a LeapMotion attached

Hey, you've got a LeapMotion attached, cool!
numSwipes 16, left 9, right 7, taps 2


I wanted this to be a complete and working example so if you have any suggestions on how to
improve it please let me know.

<script>
var debug=0;            // increasing level of debug output
var numSwipes=0;        // total count of swipes seen
var numSwipesLeft=0;
var numSwipesRight=0;
var numTaps=0;

var controller = new Leap.Controller({enableGestures: true});

controller.on('connect', function() {
	console.log("leapmotion:sucessful connection");
	foundLeap(); // let the user know we found it
});

controller.on('deviceConnected', function() {
	console.log("leapmotion:leap device has been connected");
});

controller.on('deviceDisconnected', function() {
	console.log("leapmotion:device disconnect");
});

// the frame callback is for every frame received from the leap
// which can be a lot of them, for USB 3 maybe 200 fps,
// do not uncomment this unless you want to get all of them,
// gesture detection and handling will continue to work without this
/* 
controller.on('frame', function(frame) {
	//console.log("got frame");
	var fingerIds = {};
	var handIds = {};
	if (frame.hands == undefined) {
		var handsLength = 0
	} else {
				var handsLength = frame.hands.length;
				if ((frame.hands.length != 0) && (debug>1)) console.log("hand length " + frame.hands.length);

	}
 	if (frame.gestures.length != 0) {
		if (debug>1) console.log("gesture length " + frame.gestures.length);
		
		var i =0;
		frame.gestures.forEach(function(entry) {
			if (debug>1)console.log("gesture entry " + i);
			
			i++;
		});
		
	} 
});
*/

// the gesture callback occurs on gesture detection by the leap controller,
// from here you decide which gestures that you want to handle
controller.on('gesture', function (gesture) {
  switch (gesture.type){
    case "circle":
        console.log("Circle Gesture");
        break;
    case "keyTap":
        console.log("Key Tap Gesture");
        break;
    case "screenTap":
    		handleTap(gesture);
        console.log("Screen Tap Gesture");
        break;
    case "swipe":
    		handleSwipe(gesture);
        console.log("Swipe Gesture");
        break;
  }


});





// this is where start using the leap (if one is detected)
controller.connect();

// this function is called when we want to handle a swipe gesture,
// we are just going to keep a few counts of what was detected
function handleSwipe(swipe) {
	if (swipe.state == 'stop') {
		if (debug>0) console.log("found a swipe, " + numSwipes);
		numSwipes++;
		
		// the swipe object will tell us which direction the swipe was in
		if (swipe.direction[0] > 0) {
			numSwipesRight++;
		} else {
			numSwipesLeft++;
		}
	}

	// update the webpage with out current count data
	refreshCounts();
}

// taps (poke at the screen) seem a little more difficult to detect correctly,
// i am regularly either missing the tap or getting both a swipe and a tap detection
// (but at least it is doing something)
function handleTap(tap) {
		if (debug>0) console.log("found a tap, " + numTaps);
		numTaps++;

	// update the webpage with out current count data
	refreshCounts();
